my name is shehu tangkat yakzem 
my centre name is tangkat and a member of group3
i started #codeplateau on tuesday 6 august 2019
skipped the first day because i was waiting for notificatiion text for class commencement
i was placed in group three the first week
had my classes in war room
wondered why its call war room till an instruction mentiioned reason
war room a room where one battles with codes to have it run
why should i battle my code to run when i can have code the runs without problems
the shocker of my life was when one of the instructor said if your code runs without a problem tthere is a problem
that it is a normal thing to have problem with your code
problems in coding gives more experience to developers
mistakes are part of life
war room class was great.i enjoyed every single moment of it
the instructors are wonderful
they know their onions i must say
now the journy is getting tougher
gradually gardually thing will fall in place
was disappointed and ashamed when instructor pointed out that some trainees are using the internet privided for
wrongly.downloading things unrelated to the training
i would have been guilty of connecting the network with my phone too but..
git and github at first seems easy 
its easier learning and practicing
i love every step of the instructions even though sometimes i get lost
#codeplateau has change my perspective about the workings of computer
glad to be  part of #codeplateau
